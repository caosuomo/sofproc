# SofProc
Implements an algorithm (`sofic_processor.py`) to process labeled Conley index information and produce a semi-conjugate sofic shift.
The algorithm will actually work for an arbitrary cocyclic subshift, provided the matrices have integer entries.
See `examples.py` for an illustration of the various options and subroutines.
